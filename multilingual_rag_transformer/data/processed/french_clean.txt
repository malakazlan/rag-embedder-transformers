1 Introduction
Bronchopulmonary cancer  lung  cancer  hereafter  is  the  lead-
ing  cause  of  cancer  death  worldwide  with  no  exception  for  France
where  it  was  the  cause  of  around  33000  deaths  in  2018  1  The
diseases  incidence  has  stabilized  in  men  but  it  is  rising  rapidly
in  women  53  per  year  Lung  cancers  are  usually  detected  at
advanced  stages  68  of  newly-diagnosed  patients  2  and  despite
current  advances  in  therapy  the  pathologys  five-year  survival  rate
in  those  stages  does  not  exceed  15  34   However  when  diag-
nosed at  stage  I  and  with  surgical  resection  possible  the  ten-year
survival  rate  of  lung  cancer  exceeds  80  56 
Chest  X-ray  sputum  cytology  bronchoscopy  and

for  lung  cancer  screening  710   By  contrast  low-dose  computed

trials  11  Fig  1  Among  them  however  only  two  have  sufficiently
large  enrollments  to  detect  a  possible  difference  in  lung  cancer
mortality  with  sufficient  statistical  power  the  American  National
Lung  Screening  Trial  NLST  with  90  power  to  detect  a    20
difference  in  mortality  and  the  Dutch-Belgian  NELSON  trial  with
80  power  to  detect  a  25  difference  in  male  patients  1213 
Following  the  positive  results  of  the  NLST  published  in  2011

2 Methods
A  national  group  of  experts  has  been  established  upon  a  call
for  expression  of  interest  by  IFCT  SIT  and  GOLF  as  well  as  all
experts who participated  in  the  initial  multidisciplinary  taskforce
were  also  systematically  reconvened  14  Upstream  of  the  newmeeting  a  number  of  questions  presented  as  section  headings
below  were  isolated  and  distributed  to  pairs  of  experts  for  consid-
eration  Those  expert  pairs  were  supplied  with  the  previous  texts
developed  for  the  preceding  recommendations  15  Thereafter
all  the  contributors  were  gathered  for  a  workshop  held  7th8th
November  2018  There  the  expert  pairs  presented  their  proposi-
tions  which  were  directly  discussed  and  corrected  until  obligatory
consensus  was  reached  After  the  workshop  the  rationales  of  cer-
tain  passages  were  reworked  when  needed  andor  in  the  presence
of  new  data  by  the  expert  pairs  The  final  version  of  the  text  was
fully  approved  by  all  authors  then  all  contributors  The  level  of  evi-
dence  of  the  groups  recommendations  was  graded  as  per  the  scale
of  the  Haute  Autorite  de  Sante  HAS  French  National  Authority  for
Health  Table  1
3  Should  lung  cancer  screening  be  proposed  in  France
In  2012  the  group  of  experts  stated  its  support  for  individ-
ual lung cancer screening in  precise  settings  and  with  particular
eligibility criteria  based  on  the  results  of  the  NLST  1214   This
latter involved 53454 high-risk patients  aged  55  to  74  years  with
a   30  pack-year  PY  smoking  history  and  who  had  not  quit  smok-
ing more than 15 years  prior  All  were  randomly  assigned  to  three
years of  yearly  screening  by  PA  chest  X-ray  or  LDCT  12  The  NLSTs
results showed a  significant  20  reduction  95  confidence  inter-
val  CI  68267  P    0004  in  lung  cancer-related  mortality  and
a 67 reduction  95  CI  12136  P    0020  in  all-cause  mortal-
ity  in  the  patients  screened  by  LDCT  compared  to  those  screened
by  chest  X-ray  Results  from  other  trials  on  LDCT  screening  have
since  been  reported  Fig  1  The  randomized  DLCST  trial  found
no  improvement  in  cancer-related  death  but  it  had  several  lim-
its  affecting  that  endpoint  First  the  trial  was  not  conceived  to
demonstrate  a  reduction  in  specific  mortality  but  to  be  grouped
for  analysis  with  the  NELSON  trial  an  aspect  that  explains  the  rela-
tively  modest  enrollment  for  DLCST  Also  it  reported  early  results
with  a  median  follow-up  of  only  five  years  17  Similarly  the  ten-
year  results  reported  from  the  ITALUNG  trial  were  also  negative
but  they  too  suffered  from  limited  statistical  power  18  Pooled
results from  the  Italian  DANTE  and  MILD  trials  after  a  median  eight
years  of  follow-up  were  published  in  2017  and  showed  no  signifi-
cant  mortality  benefit  for  LDCT  at  that  amount  of  surveillance  19
However  the  authors  of  the  MILD  trial  recently  provided  a  new
report  on  their  results  at  ten  years  of  follow-up  for  their  cohort
20  Although  the  MILD  trial  was  not  designed  to  detect  a  differ-
ence  in  mortality  but  to  evaluate  annual  or  biennial  screening  its
results  did  show  a  significant  39  reduction  in  lung  cancer-related
mortality  in  the  patients  who  had  LDCT  screening  annual  and  bien-
nial  grouped  compared  to  those  who  had  no  intervention  Also
recently  the  results  of  the  German  LUSI  trial  were  reported  with
a  median  follow-up  of  88  years  Here  too  the  study  cohort  was
too  small  to  ensure  sufficient  power  for  the  detection  of  a  sig-
nificant  difference  in  specific  mortality  Nonetheless  the  authors
did  report  a  26  reduction  074  95  CI  046119  P    021  in
cancer-related  mortality  for  patients  who  had  LDCT  screening  vs
X-ray  Furthermore  that  difference  significantly  benefited  women
HR    031  95  CI  010096  P    004  21  Finally  and  particu-
larly  the  eleven-year  results  of  the  NELSON  trial  were  recently
published  16  These  results  were  eagerly  awaited  as  their  sta-
tistical  power  was  sufficient  for  detecting  a  change  in  lung  cancer
mortality  in  men  initially  planned  in  association  with  the  Dan-
ish  DLCST  study  The  inclusion  criteria  of  the  NELSON  study  20
were different  from  those  of  the  NLST  especially  the  lower  age
limit  50  years  The  NELSON  study  also  had  a  different  screening
schedule with  CTs  at  baseline  detection  of  prevalent  nodules

16  As  of  this  writing  the  UKLS  and  JECS  studies  have  not  yet
provided  consolidated  results
There  are  also  a  number  of  French  studies  on  the  interest  of  lung
cancer  screening  One  modeling  study  crossed  demographic  infor-
mation  on  the  French  population  with  data  published  upstream  of
the  NELSON  study  results  Using  first  the  strict  NLST  criteria  then
those  criteria  with  the  NELSONs  50-year  age  threshold  the  authors
of  that  modeling  study  reported  screening-eligible  populations  of
respectively  1650  and  2283  people  According  to  that  study  the  costof  screening  could  be  covered  by  a  modest  10-cent  D  pack  price
increase  for  cigarettes  22  A  prospective  cohort  study  DEP  KP80
was  carried  out  in  the  French  administrative  department  of  the
Somme  23  Using  the  inclusion  criteria  of  NLST  and  a  decisional
algorithm  adapted  from  NELSON  its  baseline  results  showed  the
feasibility  and  effectiveness  of  a  yearly  LDCT  lung  cancer  screening
program  DEP  KP80  recruited  1307  patients  in  two  and  a  half  years
and  reported  a  participation  rate  of  73  and  a  positive  screening
rate  of  57  Of  these  positive  screenings  45  were  confirmed  can-
cer  n    24  and  of  these  latter  75  were  detected  at  early  stages  0
to  II
The  authors  of  DEP  KP80  considered  their  results  sufficient  to
justify  the  implementation  of  screening  in  France  the  first  step
of  which  would  be  the  deployment  of  large-scale  testing  in  pilot
regions
1  The  two  randomized  studies  with  patient  enrollments  con-
ferring  sufficient  statistical  power  satisfactorily  demonstrated
the ability  of  LDCT  screening  to  significantly  reduce  lung
cancer-specific mortality  Thus  in  accordance  with  all  inter-
national guidelines the  experts  renew  their  recommendation
in favor  of  individual  screening  for  lung  cancer  in  France  as
per  the  conditions  laid  out  in  this  document  grade  A  Here
we  defined  individual  screening  as  the  systematic  proposal
of  screening  as  described  in  this  document  by  a  physician
to  an  eligible  patient  independent  of  any  possible  national
programs2 Considering  the  rarity  of  data  on  the  feasibility  of  LDCT
screening  for  lung  cancer  in  France  the  experts  recommend
the very  rapid  organization  and  funding  of  prospective  studies
which if  conclusive  will  enable  the  deployment  of  lung  cancer
screening organized  at  the  national  level  grade  AE

4  To  whom  should  individual  lung  cancer  screening  be
proposed
The  work  group  expressed  their  opinion  that  screening  should
be  proposed  only  to  patients  whose  characteristics  would  have
made  them  eligible  for  the  NLST  or  NELSON  study  Fig  1  and
Table 2  1424   Consequently  screening  should  be  proposed  to
all  patients  aged  50  to  74  years  with  a  history  of  current  or  for-
mer  quit    10  years  prior  smoking  counting    15  cigarettesday
for    25  years  or    10  cigarettesday  for    30  years
In  the  NLST  and  NELSON  study  the  upper  age  limit  for  screening
was  74  years  The  United  States  Preventive  Services  Task  Force  rec-
ommends  screening  up  to  the  age  of  80  years  based  on  modeling
studies  using the NLST  contributively  and  performed  on  cohorts
of  American smokers  25  In  the  absence  of  prospective  Euro-
pean  data  the  work  group  decided  to  maintain  the  upper  limit  of
screening  initiation  to  74  years  and  proposed  additional  research
on  advanced  age  groups
In  the  NLST  patients  who  had  quit  smoking  within  the  preced-
ing  15  years  were  eligible  for  enrollment  In  the  NELSON  trial  that
interval  was  limited  to  10  years  The  present  expert  group  considers
that  patients  eligible  for  screening  on  all  other  criteria  and  having
quit  smoking    10  prior  or  optionally    15  years  prior  may  benefit
from  screening
A  number  of  teams  have  studied  the  contribution  of  risk  model-
ing  which  integrates  novel  variables  to  optimize  the  identification
of  screening  candidates  Risk  scores  are  conceived  to  improve
screening  performance  with  such  goals  as  for  example  reduc-
ing  the  number  of  individuals  to  screen  to  detect  one  cancer  or
prevent  one  death  26  These  scores  often  built  upon  clinical
andor  radiological  data  do  appear  pertinent  2729   but  none
have  been  compared  in  prospective  randomized  trials  In  the  UKLS
trial  the  LLPv2  Liverpool  Lung  Project   score  was  not  a  random-
ization  but  an  inclusion  criterion  Of  all  the  randomized  trials  the
UKLS  trial  identified  the  highest  proportion  of  stage  I  or  II  lung  can-
cers  The  PLCOm2012  score  was  used  to  select  eligible  patients  in
the  prospective  PanCan  trial  In  its  cohort  the  cumulative  incidence
rate  for  cancer  was  significantly  higher  than  that  of  NLST  with  fur-
thermore  a  higher  proportion  of  stage  III  cancers  77  vs  57
P    0001  For  other  lung  cancer  risk  factors  professional  or  envi-
ronmental  carcinogen  exposure  rare  hereditary  predispositions
comorbidities  there  are  currently  insufficient  data  in  the  literature
to  propose  specific  recommendations
All  patients  who  accept  screening  must  do  so  voluntarily  after
having  received  complete  information  on  the  possible  benefits  and
risks  see  below  They  may  need  time  to  reflect  on  whether  to
accept  screening  Current  smokers  must  be  strongly  encouraged  to
join  a  smoking  cessation  program  and  oriented  toward  profession-
als  andor  institutions  specialized  in  smoking  cessation  in  France
   Encouraging  the  patient  to  stop
smoking  must  be  systematically  repeated  at  ever  screening  visit
and smoking  cessation  counseling  formally  integrated  in  the  pro-
cess  30  No  particular  cessation  strategy  has  demonstrated  its
superiority  over  any  other  3133 
Patients  who  have  developed  symptoms  or  signs  suggestive  of
lung  cancer  hemoptysis  weight  loss    10  of  normal  weight  andor
lung  infection  in  the  preceding  year  must  undergo  immediate
diagnostic  work-ups  they  are  thus  not  candidates  for  screening
Also  screening  should  not  be  proposed  to  patients  meeting  NELSON
andor  NLST  exclusion  criteria  Table  2  including  severe  comor-
bidities  contraindicating  invasive  thoracic  procedures  and  thus  any
surgical  treatments  LDCT  screening  is  not  a  substitute  for  diagnos-
tic  examinations  when  respiratory  disease  is  suspected  Finally
patients  with  a  history  of  cancer  are  to  be  placed  under  specific
surveillance  and  thus  the  work  group  does  not  recommend  includ-
ing  them  in  individual  lung  cancer  screening  procedures4  Individual  LDCT  screening  for  lung  cancer  should  be  thor-
oughly explained  informed  consent  and  proposed  to  all
patients aged    50  years  who  have  a  current  or  recent  past
cessation  within the preceding  10  years  history  of  smok-
ing   15  cigarettesday  for    25  years  OR    10  cigarettesday
for    30  years  and  who  do  not  meet  exclusion  criteria  Entry
into  a  screening  program  may  be  proposed  to  patients  up  to
74  years  of  age  grade  A
5  Ex-smokers  who  meet  the  above  criteria  but  quit  smok-
ing   10 but   15  years  prior  may  be  proposed  screening  as  an
option grade  AE
6  Patients  who  have  a  history  of  cancer  present  clinical  signs
suggesting  cancer  recently  underwent  a  thoracic  CT  for  other
reasons  or  present  one  or  several  severe  comorbidities  con-
traindicating invasive thoracic procedures are ineligible for
LDCT
 screening  grade  A
5  What  is  the  optimal  duration  of  screening
There  are  few  prospective  data  available  on  the  optimal  dura-
tion  of  lung  cancer  screening  in  at-risk  patients  The  cohort  from
the  ELCAP  study  was  compared  to  that  of  another  study  CARET
not  involving  screening  The  comparison  clearly  showed  that  inter-
rupting  screening  was  associated  with  an  increase  in  the  rate  of  lung
cancer-related  death  34  Complementarily  Veronesi  et  al  showed
that  the  rate  of  lung  cancer  detection  remained  stable  across  a  long
duration  of  yearly  LDCT  screening  3536 
Other  elements  also  argue  in  favor  of  regular  screening  for
lung  cancer  such  as  its  comparability  with  other  cancer  screen-
ing programs  the  theoretical  need  for  continuous  screening  or  the
consistent  cancer  detection  rates  observed  in  all  three  of  the  NLSTs
annual  screenings  respectively  1  07  and  09  12  The  persis-
tence  of  the  effectiveness  of  screening  when  maintained  beyond
three  to  five  years  was  recently  demonstrated  in  the  NELSON  study
wherein  a  fourth  screening  CT  was  done  55  years  after  inclusion
and  concerned  thus  5279  patients  ie  68  of  the  initially-included
experimental  group  That  fourth  screening  was  positive  in  105
patients  ie  2  of  the  5279  participants  among  which  43  08
were  diagnosed  with  cancer  for  a  positive  predictive  value  PPV  of
41  which  was  similar  to  the  mean  PPV  of  all  four  of  the  NELSON
studys  screening  rounds  37  Thus  at  five  and  a  half  years  and  even
further up  to  eleven  years  the  cumulative  number  of  detected  lung
cancers  remained  significantly  higher  in  the  experimental  group  vs
the  control  group  Finally  the  relative  risk  of  lung  cancer-related
death  was  significantly  reduced  from  24  by  year  at  eight  to  ten
years  and  by  22  at  eleven  years  in  men  In  women  lung  cancer
mortality  was  significantly  reduced  by  54  59  and  48  at  7  8
and  9  years  respectively  16
More  recently  the  ten-year  data  of  the  randomized  MILD  trial
were  published  In  MILD  either  annual  n    1190  or  biennial
n    1186  screening  was  maintained  for  ten  years  and  the  results
compared  to  those  of  a  control  group  20  The  trial  showed  an  over-
all  reduction  in  cancer-related  mortality  with  that  benefit  being
more  pronounced  after  five  years  Thus  at  ten  years  the  sex  age
and  consumption  in  PY-adjusted  overall  death  risk  was  signifi-
cantly  lowered  by  32  and  the  lung  cancer-related  death  risk  was
reduced  by  68  These  data  convincingly  demonstrate  that  screen-
ing  continues  to  reduce  the  risk  of  lung  cancer-related  death  when
continued  for  at  least  ten  years

6 How  frequently  should  screening  CT  be  performed
The  optimal  interval  between  screening  LDCT  has  not  yet  been
clearly  established  In  a  debated  interim  analysis  within  the  MILD
trial  an  increase  in  the  cumulative  incidence  of  lung  cancers  was
observed  in  the  annual  compared  to  the  biennial  screening  group
excluding  nonsolid  nodules  but  there  was  no  sign  of  an  increase
in  advanced-stage  detections  in  the  biennial  group  Furthermore
there  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  the
annual  and  biennial  screening  groups  in  terms  of  mortality  test
performance  sensitivity  specificity  predictive  values  or  number
of  interval  lung  cancers  those  detected  between  screening  CT

The  NELSON  trial  performed  a  baseline  screening  first  round
and  thereafter  spaced  their  screenings  incrementally  with  first  a
one-year  second  round  then  a  two-year  third  round  and  finally
an  optional  two  and  a  half-year  fourth  round  interval  In  com-
parison  to  the  trials  second  screening  round  the  fourth  round
detected  significantly  less  stage  IA  cancers  759  vs  609  and
more  stage  IIIBIV  cancers  68  vs  173  P    002  In  comparison
to  the  third  screening  round  the  fourth  round  again  detected  less
stage  IA  cancers  727  vs  609  and  more  stage  IIIBIV  cancers
but  this  time  without  statistical  significance  P    010  Nonethe-
less  the  number  of  cancers  detected  in  the  fourth  screening  round
five  and  a  half  years  after  baseline  was  only  slightly  and  statis-
tically  insignificantly  lower  than  those  of  the  preceding  rounds
suggesting  a  screening  performance  rate  of  lung  cancer  detection
that is  not  inferior  to  other  intervals  There  was  however  the  draw-
back  of  a  greater  number  of  interval  cancers  observed  in  that  two
and  a  half-year  period  between  the  trials  third  and  four  screen-
ing  rounds  37  An  analysis  of  the  results  from  the  one  and  two
year  intervals  second  and  third  rounds  showed  that  there  was  no
statistically  significant  difference  between  them  in  the  number  of
cancers  detected  in  later  stages  P    009  41
In  the  absence  of  personalized  risk  assessments  these  results
argue  in  favor  of  a  screening  interval  of  two  years  at  the  most
Based  on  a  modeling  study  of  the  NELSON  data  it  does  appear  that
shorter  screening  intervals  do  have  a  greater  effect  on  reducing
mortality  with  one  two  and  three-year  intervals  between  screen-
ings  reducing  that  endpoint  respectively  from  11  to  21  65  to  96
and  46  to  6  Annual  screening  does  thus  appear  to  be  more  cost-
effective  when  considered  in  terms  of  life-years  saved  compared
to  saved  costs  4243   Furthermore  another  work  derived  from
the  NELSON  trial  demonstrated  a  significantly  longer  preclinical
time  the  time  needed  to  progress  from  stage  IA  to  stage  II  for  IAadenocarcinoma in  women  244  years  compared  to  men
182 years  but  no  such  difference  was  detected  for  other
histopathological  types  between  sexes  44
Equally  the  results  of  preceding  screening  rounds  appear  to
be  an  important  predictive  element  45  Indeed  post-hoc  anal-
yses  of  NLST  data  have  shown  that  incidence  and  mortality  are
inversely  related  to  a  preceding  negative  screening  and  that  the
effect  strengthens  with  a  second  preceding  negative  screening
Other  variables  significantly  associated  with  the  risk  of  cancer
diagnosis  were  a  known  history  of  COPD  and  CT  detection  of
emphysema  46
These  data  were  furthermore  confirmed  in  the  NELSON  study  In
its  fourth  round  the  risk  of  lung  cancer  was  06  for  patients  with
negative  results  from  all  the  preceding  three  rounds  but  16  for
those  with  at  least  one  indeterminate  round  but  never  a  positive
round  and  37  for  those  with  an  indeterminate  third  round  vs
06  for  those  with  a  negative  third  round  37  Finally  the  NELSON
trial  also  showed  that  the  risk  of  cancer  was  correlated  to  nodule
size  and  nodule  volume  doubling  time  VDT  47
Thus  several  authors  have  suggested  personalizing  screening
intervals  after  the  second  screening  as  a  function  of  the  patients
individual  risk  profile  as  determined  by  prediction  scores  such  as
PLCO m2012 or  the  radiological  data  from  the  first  baseline  screen-
ing  Very  recently  the  team  behind  the  PLCO  cancer  risk  prediction
model  developed  and  validated  a  model  wherein  preceding  screen-
ing  results  are  considered  in  addition  to  the  PLCO m2012 variables
45  Their  results  suggested  that  for  at-risk  patients  PLCO    13
for the  NCCN    2  risk  in  the  Cancer  Care  Ontario  pilot  study  cohort
the  screening  interval  should  be  maintained  at  one  year  whereas
for  others  an  interval  of  two  years  may  be  proposed  Setting  a
screening  interval  based  on  individual  risk  would  of  course  reduce
costs  and  furthermore  lower  exposure  to  radiation  for  people  at  low
risk  who  could  be  scheduled  for  screening  once  every  two  years
However  no  prospective  studies  have  been  done  on  this  strategy
7 What  technical  procedures  are  necessary  for  screening
Lung  cancer  screening  is  performed  via  a  volumetric  unen-
hanced LDCT scan 4849   Scanners  with    16  raws  of  detectors
should  be used  for  acquisitions  these  latter  taken  with  the  patient
in the supine  position  arms  extended  behind  the  head  during  a
deep-inspiration  breath-hold  and  covering  the  lung  from  its  apex
through  to  the  inferior  pleural  recesses  Native  slice  thickness
should be    125  mm  with  a  30-overlap  reconstruction  to  enable
volumetric  analysis  of  abnormalities
203S  Couraud  G  Ferretti  B  Milleron  et  al  Diagnostic  and  Interventional  Imaging  102  2021  199211
8  Considering  the  current  state  of  knowledge  and  the  absence
of risk  personalization  the  expert  group  recommends  a  max-
imum interval  of  two  years  between  LDCT  screenings  grade
B9 Pending  specific  studies  it  seems  reasonable  to  initially
propose  two  screenings  with  a  one-year  interval  between
them  When  both  are  negative  and  the  patient  has  no  risk
factors  other  than  tobacco  use  eg  emphysema  history  of
COPD  biennial  screening  may  be  proposed  Screening  must
however remain  annual  in the presence  of  any  additional  risk
factors andor  any  indeterminate  screening  result  grade  AE
There  is  currently  no  consensus  definition  of  low-dose  CT
Considering the  diverse  range  of  employed  CT  equipment  radia-
tion  limits  should  not  be  expressed  in  terms  of  volts  or  milliamps
but  instead  in volume CT  dose  index  CTDI  with  a  goal  of  achiev-
ing a  volumetric  CTDI  or  CTDIvol  of  no  more  than  3  mGy  in
a standard-size patient height  170  cm  weight  70  kg  5051
and for  instance    04  mGy  for  patients  weighing    50  kg    08  mGy
for  patients weighing   50  to    80  kg  and    16  mGy  for  patients
weighing   80  kg  DLP  and  CTDI  should  be  indicated  on  the  imag-
ing study report Ultra-low-dose  CT  dose  close  to  that  of  a
frontal   lateral  chest  X-ray  currently  lacks  sufficient  validation  for
deployment in screening  5052   However  techniques  to  optimize
image  noise  to  irradiation  ratios  such  as  iterative  reconstruction  or
deep learning are  recommended
Readings  should  be  done  at  the  workstation  from  axial  slices  no
thicker  than  15  mm  reconstructed  in  lung  parenchyma  and  medi-
astinal  windows  and  furthermore  in  multiplanar  reconstruction  for
detected  abnormalities  Maximum  intensity  projections  with  slab
thicknesses  of  5  to  8  mm  should  be  used  to  optimize  the  detection
of  peripheral  solid  nodules  53  Second-reading  computer-aided
detection  CAD  has  been  shown  to  increase  lung  nodule  detection
sensitivity  76  compared  to  results  provided  by  single  50  or
double  63  human  readers  54  Within  a  study  involving  400
CT  examinations  randomly  chosen  from  the  NELSON  trial  double
radiologist  reading  22  of  nodules    50  mm3  including  one  can-
cer were  identified  only  by  CAD  55  That  study  reported  detection
rates  of  78  and  97  respectively  for  double  readings  and  CAD
ie  19  more  nodules  using  the  latter  compared  to  the  former
It  also  reported  that  false-positives  by  CAD  could  be  limited  by
excluding  nodules  measuring  less  than  50  mm3equivalent  to  a
mean  diameter  of  5  mm  55  Those  results  were  confirmed  in  a
study  performed  on  anthropomorphic  phantoms  to  compare  vari-
ous  combinations  of  single  or  double  readings  and  three  different
CAD  programs  for  solid  and  nonsolid  nodules  measuring    5  mm
Combining  one  human  reader  with  one  CAD  provided  sensitivities
constantly  greater  than  those  obtained  by  any  combination  of  two
CADs  9799  vs  8588  56  In  the  setting  of  organized  screen-
ing  it  appears  more  realistic  to  systematically  deploy  a  second
reading  by  CAD  with  a  predefined  detection  threshold  rather  than
double  radiologist  readings  Limitations  to  the  use  of  CAD  include
an  increase  in  reading  time  the  management  of  false-positives  and
a  lower  sensitivity  for  the  detection  of  nonsolid  nodules  57  In
the  near  future  the  introduction  of  artificial  intelligence  should
improve  CAD  performance  and  ultimately  will  find  itself  the  subject
of  research  notably  through  radio-banking  58  An  advantage  of
CAD  is  that  it  can  be  paired  with  volumetric  evaluation  of  detected
nodules  for  immediate  classification  according  to  guidelines  59
The  interpretation  of  screening-derived  CT  images  must  be
entrusted  to  radiologists  specialized  in  thoracic  imaging  or  thereto
trained  via  specific  validated  programs  Nodule  volume  mea-
surements should  be  done  with  dedicated  software  on  standard

8  How  screening  CT  should  be  interpreted
There  are  several  formalized  guidelines  for  screening-detected
nodule  management  including  those  of  the  Fleischner  Society
4962    which  were  edited  for  incidentally  found  nodules  
or the  LungRADS  classification  updated  to  version  11  in  2019
of  the  American  College  of  Radiology  The  American  College
of  Radiologys  Lung  CT  Screening  Reporting    Data  System
is  available  at  
and-Data-SystemsLung-Rads   accessed  05  July  2019  These  guide-
lines  define  positive  tests  in  different  ways  and  have  not  been
subjected  to  prospective  comparative  trials  as  of  this  writing  In
addition  to  those  formalized  guidelines  there  are  also  clinical  trial
protocols  including  those  for  the  NLST  and  NELSON  study  that  have
been  prospectively  tested  in  the  setting  of  a  randomized  trial  with
definitions  for  positive  indeterminate  for  NELSON  or  negative
tests  as  well  as  associated  decisional  algorithms  The  NELSON  trial
defined  a positive screening via a combination  of  nodule  presence
and
 size  volume  with  a  later  contribution  of  VDT  That  approach
yielded a PPV of 41 Comparatively the  NLST  wherein  all  non-
calcified
 nodules    4  mm  were  considered  positive  reported  a  PPV
of  36 and a criticized false-positive  rate  of  96  12474858 
Several post-hoc  analyses  were  programmed  as  part  of  the  NEL-
SON trial with the goal  of  better  identifying  at-risk  abnormalities
by for  example  refining  thresholds  for  nodule  volume  or  VDT  On
another point those  analyses  showed  notably  that  incident  nodules
those  not  present  in  preceding  screenings  carried  a  greater  risk  of
malignancy 6364   The  threshold  refinements  however  although
interesting  in  theory  did  not  appear  to  demonstrate  an  interest
Indeed  such  changes  performed  inferiorly  to  the  initial  protocol
notably  in  terms  of  PPV  and  specificity  4765 
Nonetheless  a  group  of  authors  who  participated  in  screening
programs  in  eight  European  countries  recently  published  an  expert
opinion  recommending  the  use  of  the  threshold  refinements  devel-
oped  in  the  above-mentioned  post-hoc  analyses  for  solid  nodules
58  Those  threshold  refinements  are  also  forwarded  in  recent  rec-
ommendations  by  the  European  Society  of  Radiology  ESR  and
the  European  Respiratory  Society  ERS  66  The  refined  positivity
thresholds  vary  for  prevalent  nodules  present  at  baseline  100  to
300  mm3and  VDT  of  600  days  or  incident  30  to  200  mm3and  VDT
of  600  days  and  remaining  inferior  to  200  mm3or  8  mm  nodules
these latter necessitating a  greater  level  of  attention  Notwithstand-
ing the  positioning  of  these  other  expert  groups  the  French  expert
group  recommends  the  nodule  interpretation  rules  defined  in  the
initial  NELSON  protocol  whatever  the  type  of  nodule  considering
that  these  rules  only  have  been  validated  in  a  prospective  random-
ized  trial  1648   This  recommendation  necessitated  votes  among

The  analysis  of  a  CT  screening  will  give  one  of  three  possible

cious  abnormalities  and  necessitating  only  the  maintenance  of  the

resenting only a  temporary  result  and  necessitating  a  follow-up

tiple  nodules  the  strategy  to  be  deployed  is  that  pertinent  to  the

ule types  solid  part-solid  nonsolid  detected  in  LDCT   This

tion  in  the  setting  of  solid  nodules  and  1020  voted  for  it  in  the
setting  of  subsolid  nodules  grade  AE
9 Decision-making  strategy  for solid nodules
The  first  step  in the presence  of  a  solid  nodule  is  to  determine  if
it  meets  benignity  criteria If the nodule is  entirely  calcified  or  if  it
has a  central  calcification  on two orthogonal  planes  the  screening
is considered  negative  regardless  of  nodule  size  In  this  case  the
established screening  schedule  may  be  maintained  Other  benig-
nity  criteria  include  an  intranodular  fat  deposit  40  to  120
Hounsfield  units  or  features  suggesting  an  intrapulmonary  lymph
node  solid  homogenous  density  size    10  mm    10  mm  from  a
pleural  surface  location  inferior  to  the  tracheal  carina  triangular
or oval  shape  connection  to  adjacent  pleura  by  a  thin  septum  14
For  non-calcified  solid  nodules  the  main  feature  to  be  consid-
ered  is  nodal  volume  or  failing  that  the  mean  of  the  long  and  short
axes  Fig  2  Because  nodules  are  never  perfectly  spherical  there
is  no  strict  proportionality  between  volume  and  diameter  mea-
surements  As  a  simplification  measure  the  diameter  thresholds
given  below  have  been  rounded  consequently  they  do  not  corre-
late  strictly  with  the  corresponding  volume  thresholds  It  is  also
important  to  underline  the  need  for  identical  acquisition  parame-
ters  when  calculating  VDT  from  two  volumetric  evaluations
Non-calcified  nodules  measuring    50  mm3or  with  a  diam-
eter    5  mm  indicate  a  negative  screening  and  the  patient  may
maintain  the  established  screening  schedule  Non-calcified  nod-
ules  measuring    500  mm3or  with  a  diameter    10  mm  indicate
a  positive  screening  and  the  patient  must  be  referred  to  an
MDT  for  the  determination  of  complementary  investigations  Non-
calcified  nodules  measuring  in  between  those  thresholds  indicate
an  indeterminate  screening  A  follow-up  CT  should  be  scheduled
at  three  months  68  weeks  for  incidental  nodules  for  nodal  vol-
ume  or  mean  diameter  comparisons  and  VDT  calculations  A
VDT    400  days  indicates  a  negative  test  and  the  patient  may  return
to  the  established  screening  schedule  Inversely  a  VDT    400  days
indicates  a  positive  test  and  the  patient  must  be  referred  to  a  MDT

positive  screenings  Patients  with  nodal  volumes  in  between
the  above  thresholds  should  be  scheduled  for  a  follow-up  CT

upon that  follow-up  CT   VDTs    400  days  and    400  days  indi-

10 Decision-making  strategy  for  subsolid  nodules
Particularities  in  the  management  of  subsolid  nodules  arise
from  on  one  hand  their  propensity  to  self-resolve  approxi-
mately  50  of  nodules  but  on  the  other  hand  their  tendency
to  become  adenocarcinomasalbeit  generally  non  or  minimally
invasivewhen  they  do  not  resolve  6268   It  is  these  indolent
lesions  that  are  most  likely  to  expose  patients  to  overdiagnosis
6970   Thus  in  the  presence  of  subsolid  nodules  surveillance
should  be  given  priority  to  avoid  that  risk  58  Also  in  this

PET-CT  for  nonsolid  nodules
In  a  position  statement  some  European  experts  recommended
the  deployment  of  the  protocol  proposed  by  the  British  Thoracic
Society  5871   That  protocol  is  however  complex  and  unvalidated
in  prospective  trials  as  of  this  writing  With  the  present  document
the  French  expert  group  recommends  the  prospectively-validated
NELSON  trial  protocol  48  This  latter  distinguishes  nonsolid  and
part-solid  nodules  Nonsolid  nodules  are  described  using  the  mean
of  the  long  and  short  axes  When  it  is    8  mm  the  screening  may
be  considered  negative  When  it  is    8  mm  the  screening  should  be
considered  indeterminate  and  the  patient  rescheduled  for  a  follow-
up  CT  in  three  months  If  no  solid  component  has  appeared  the
screening  is  considered  negative  otherwise  it  is  considered  pos-
itive  Fig  3  Specialist  opinion  should  be  however  considered  in

of  those  two  variables  Fig  4

scanner11  What  information  should  be  provided  to  eligible
patients
Cancer  screening  is  of  interest  only  if  it  reduces  mortality
from  the  cancer  it  targets  Screening  for  lung  cancer  does  so
and  in  a  statistically  significant  fashion  as  shown  by  three  stud-
ies  the  American  NLST    50000  participants  and  the  European
NELSON    15000  participants  and  MILD    4000  participants
studies  Thus  deploying  lung  cancer  screening  does  appear  to  be
advantageous  but  doing  so  has  consequences  that  must  be  com-
municated  to  screening-eligible  patients  Appendix  1  Principally
these  latter  must  be  informed  about  the  high-risk  of  discovering  an
abnormalitywhatever  the  naturethat  could  necessitate  further
and  sometimes  invasive  investigations  Considering  the  NELSON
data  of  every  1000  patients  who  underwent  screening  22  had  pos-
itive  results  and  among  them  9  were  ultimately  diagnosed  with
lung  cancer  That  result  implies  13  false-positives  that  would  need
complementary  examinations  most  being  supplementary  imaging
studies  rather  than  invasive  procedures  that  could  cause  compli-
cations  Information  provided  to  patients  must  emphasize  that
the  risk  of  cancer  discovery  remains  low  at  about  09  to  37  in
the  screening-eligible  population  1216   The  psychological  impact
resulting  from  the  possible  discovery  of  an  abnormality  must  be
discussed  with  patients  as  must  the  sometimes  large  amount  of
time  needed  to  determine  benignity  or  malignancy  On  those  points
however  several  research  teams  have  looked  at  the  effects  of  LDCT
cancer  screening  on  patient  anxiety  and  quality  of  life  and  reported
relatively  reassuring  findings  7277 
Also  to  be  considered  is  the  risk  of  overdiagnosis  ie  the
discovery  of  indolent  tumors  that  would  have  never  manifested
clinically  nor  caused  the  death  of  the  patient  That  said  this  risk
is  likely  globally  infrequent  in  lung  cancer  where  VDT  is  usually
short about  180  days  on  average  7879   Evaluating  overdiagno-
sis  in  this  setting  is  complex  According  to  different  studies  and
especially  different  employed  methodologies  it  may  occur  in  0
to  67  of  cases  188081   The  NLST  reported  an  estimated  138
cases  of  overdiagnosis  for  every  320  patients  who  would  need  to

Fig  4  Proposition  for  a  part-solid  or  sub-solid  nodule  lung  nodule  decisional  algorithm  adapted  from  ref  48
be  screened  to  avoid  one  lung  cancer  death  80  Very  recently
an  article  on  extended  follow-up  results  12  years  for  the  NLST
reported  a  reassuring  3  rate  of  overdiagnosis  noting  however  that
this  was  after  the  exclusion  of  bronchioloalveolarlepidic  adeno-
carcinomas  corresponding  morphologically  to  subsolid  nodules
which  carry  a  very  high  rate  of  overdiagnosis  approaching  80  70
Thus  the  risk  of  overdiagnosis  in  lung  cancer  screening  appears
to  be  present  mainly  in  subsolid  nodules  which  show  longer
VDTs  sometimes  exceeding  400  days  Nonetheless  the  degener-
ative  potential  of  subsolid  nodules  must  not  be  underestimated  as
they  are  able  to  evolve  sometimes  quite  belatedly  into  invasive
and  even  metastatic  cancer  Therefore  some  of  these  nodules  may
in  reality  be  slow-growing  cancers  6982   which  leads  less  to  a
overdiagnosis  bias  than  to  a  leadtime  bias  These  lesions  thus  do
require long-term  monitoring  and  may  deserve  MDT  consideration
Unneeded  investigations and  treatments  can  be  avoided  by
following  recommendations  for  the  management  of  screening-
detected  nodules  In  the  NELSON  trial  264  subsolid  nodules  were
detected in  234  patients  representing  33  of  all  detected  nod-
ules  It  must  be  underlined  that  more  than  half  of  those  nodulesdisappeared  during  follow-up  confirming  their  benignity  and
probable  infectious  etiology  Of  the  33  subsolid  nodules  resected
in  the  NELSON  trial  28  were  confirmed  as  non-small  cell  lung  can-
cers  among  which  nine  were  in  situ  adenocarcinomas  Of  the  19
resected  invasive  cancers  16  had  VDTs    400  days  The  other  nod-
ules  were  assigned  to  monitoring  83  Only  07  of  the  NELSON
trial  participants  had  incident  subsolid  nodules  84
Also  an  important  isue  is  the  radiation  exposure  resulting  from
repeat  CT  examination  In  the  NLST  the  mean  LDCT  dose  was
15  mSv  The  mean  natural  irradiation  in  France  is  29  mSv  per
year  Institut  de  Radioprotection  et  de  Surete  Nucleaire  IRSN
French  Institute  for  Radioprotection  and  Nuclear  Safety  2015
For  comparison  frontal  and  frontal    lateral  chest  X-rays  deliver
respectively  005  and  02  mSv  LDCT  screening-eligible  patients
should be  informed  that  any  one  CT  corresponds  to  six  months
of  natural exposure  at  the  most  Although  the  risk  of  devel-
oping  radiation-induced  cancer  cannot  be  totally  eliminated  it
does  appear  to  be  extremely  low  notably  considering  the  age  of
patients eligible  for  screening  85  Furthermore  the  reduction
in  overall  mortality  observed  in  the  NLST  suggests  an  absence  of
207S  Couraud  G  Ferretti  B  Milleron  et  al  Diagnostic  and  Interventional  Imaging  102  2021  199211
significant  consequences  on  survival  In  the  Italian  ITALUNG  trial
in  which  3206  patients  were  randomized  to  five  years  of  annual
LDCT  screening  or  no  screening  for  lung  cancer  the  mean  cumu-
lated  individual  irradiation  dose  in  the  patients  concerned  by  it
ranged  from  62  to  68  mSv  The  screening  CT  themselves  were
responsible  for  77  of  that  exposure  and  complementary  examina-
tions  for  the  remaining  23  86  Some  authors  have  underlined  the
deleterious  effects  of  overstating  the  risks  of  radiation  to  patients
including  that  of  premature  mortality  caused  by  the  non-detection
of  serious  pathologies  whereas  any  theoretical  risk  caused  by  irra-
diation  would  appear  many  years  after  the  examination  if  at  all
87  However  the  advent  of  ultra-low  dose  scanners  that  will  pro-
vide  comparable  nodule-detection  capacities  for  a  radiation  dose
025  mSv  close  to  that  of  a  chest  X-ray  will  probably  change  the
game  in  the  future  5052 
Finally  the  issue  of  smoking  cessation  must  be  discussed  with
screening  candidates  and  the  degree  of  nicotine  dependency  eval-
uated  for them The  participants  in  the  ACRIN  arm  of  the  NLST  had
provided  particularly  high  amounts  of  smoking  data  A  recent  study
focusing on those  NLST  participants  88  confirmed  increased  rates
of  lung  cancer  and  specific  and  all-cause  mortality  in  patients  with
higher vs lower  dependency  scores  Cessation  is  thus  a  major  issue
The  NLST  counted  24190  current  and  26073  former  smokers  The
control groups former  smokers  who  had  seven  years  of  abstinence
showed  20  less  lung  cancer-specific  mortality  ie  a  reduction
equivalent  to  that  obtained  by  the  LDCT  screening  program  The
experimental  groups  ie  those  who  received  LDCT  screening  for-
mer  smokers  abstinent  for  seven  years  did  even  better  with  a  30
reduction  in  that  same  endpoint  However  the  best  result  38
in  specific  mortality  was  obtained  in  patients  who  were  abstinent
for  15  years  and  in  the  experimental  group  89  Participation  in  a
screening  program  can  however  contribute  to  cessation  The  NLST
observed  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  active  smokers  each  year
and  that  reduction  was  stronger  in  patients  for  whom  screening
results  were  positive  with  features  highly  suggestive  of  cancer  90
The  patients  who  quit  smoking  in  these  conditions  appeared  to  do
so  durably  For  all  of  the  above  reasons  smoking  cessation  assis-
tance  must  be  systematically  proposed  to  all  patients  undergoing
LDCT  for  lung  cancer  screening  The  work  group  recommends  that
information on  smoking  cessation  be  provided  in  both  oral  and
written  forms  Appendix  1
17 Precise  information  on  the  benefits  of  screening  the  pos-
sible  risks  of  screening  including  overdiagnosis  and  tobacco
cessation  must  be  provided  to  patients  before  they  partici-
pate in  an  individual  LDCT  screening  program  for  lung  cancer
grade AE
12 Conclusion
Although  the  effectiveness  of  LDCT  for  lung  cancer  screening  has
been  clearly  demonstrated  its  optimization  remains  dependent  on
the  clarification  of  numerous  points  In  the  opinion  of  the  work
group  there  are  three  topics  that  merit  prioritized  investigation
The  first  topic  is  favoring  the  adherence  of  the  eligible  population
to  the  screening  program  in  its  entirety  including  smoking  cessa-
tion  The  second  topic  is  optimizing  eligible  population  selection
and  identifying  patients  eligible  for  but  not  receiving  screening
For  these  two  points  pooled  subgroups  analysis  may  be  helpful
The  third  topic  is  intensifying  the  study  of  radiomics  with  arti-
ficial  intelligence  9192  and  biomarkers  in  the  setting  of  lung
cancer screening  and  the  contributions  they  may  make  to  it  Finally
costriskbenefits  analysis  adapted  to  each  healthcare  system  arealso  essentials  Thus  the  experts  renew  their  recommendation  in
favor  of  individual  screening  for  lung  cancer  in  France  as  per  the
conditions  laid  out  in  this  document  grade  A  and  recommend  the
very  rapid  organization  and  funding  of  prospective  studies  which
if  conclusive  will  enable  the  deployment  of  lung  cancer  screening
organized  at  the  national  level  grade  AE
